# Flutter Counter App (SharedPreferences)

This repository contains a **Flutter Counter App** that demonstrates persistent local data storage using `SharedPreferences`.  
The application maintains a counter value that is saved locally and restored automatically when the app is reopened.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The purpose of this minor project is to understand how Flutter applications can store and retrieve simple data locally.  
The app uses `SharedPreferences` to persist the counter value, ensuring data is not lost when the application is closed.
